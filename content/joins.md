# Joins

What they are why there are useful different kinds
can join geospatial layers or non geospatial layers

## Join attributes by field value
how to find key attribute 


## Spatial Joins
- Join attributes by location
- Join attributes by location (summary)
- Join attributes by nearest


## Virtual Layers
- Build virtual layer of vectors
many to one etc - eg bc dls grid 
- Build virtual raster layer


Notes - How intersect can be a work around

### Example: Join artists with public art
data layers are two different types
check attribute tablesâ€¦
what could be common key, what issues do you notice? (artist ID, artists; 1 to many join; artist IDs are integers whereas artist field is text)
what join will you do and what will you have to do in preparation for join?
