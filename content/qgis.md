# What is QGIS?

A Geographic Information System (GIS) works with data that is tied to a location on Earth. This type of data is often referred to as GIS data, or geospatial data, and is spatially referenced to Earth using location information – most commonly geographic coordinates. A GIS uses this location information to project a geospatial file into a virtual geographic space where it can then be visualized and analyzed. [**QGIS**](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is a popular desktop GIS software, and considered a **f**ree and **o**pen **s**ource **s**oftware **(FOSS)** with a very active development community. 

### QGIS Pros⇡
- Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
- Extensive [online documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)
- Active development and user communities
- Robust [plugin repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/) for extended functionality

### QGIS Cons⇣
- Most recent features can be buggy
- Plugins lack standardized documentation
- Troubleshooting = Googling 


## Downloading and Installing QGIS
QGIS can be downloaded from [qgis.org's Downloads page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In most cases, you'll want to download and install the **Long term release** (LTR) instead of the latest release. The link for this download is just below the big green button. Downloading the QGIS-LTR will give you most of the functionality you'll need, without encountering the software bugs of newly released versions.

- [Map Production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/)
- [QGIS User Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/index.html) 
- [QGIS Training Material](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)
- [Spatial Thoughts Academy QGIS course](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/introduction-to-qgis.html)
- Numerous youtube videos and tutorials online, such as this [free comprehensive courses for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKlk3IXyPMo), or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SovdBaus7pM), or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHolzMgaqwE&list=PLLxyyob7YmEHFg5xvwszKIo_sNZbczlNC). Central Washington University Department of Geography has a great [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cwugeography3290) with QGIS demonstrations. If the QGIS Versions don't entirely match yours, that's okay! The interface is stilly pretty much the same.
- Search your questions on the internet. It's likely you're not the first one to run into an issue. Use specific jargon as search terms; for instance, if you want to know what the resolution of a raster means, search 'resolution meaning raster'. Browse youtube videos. Scroll through stack exchange conversations.
