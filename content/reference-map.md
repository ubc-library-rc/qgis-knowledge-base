# Make a Reference Map
A simple reference map can add useful context to your academic article, poster, or presentation. In order to make a reference map with a GIS — whether it be QGIS, ArcGIS, or another GIS — it's recommended you have a basic familiarity with the application. If you've never used QGIS, review the Research Commons' workshop on [map production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/)before getting started.

1. What are you mapping? If point, area, etc - need to assemble data layers. 
 - create a point, create or extract an area, shading etc. 
2. Basemap - weather sattelite imagery or vector data 
 - natural earth shapefiles (can always select and export single country)
3. Clip/process
4. symbology
5. Make layout - add scalebar, title, label, north arrow, legend
6. export
