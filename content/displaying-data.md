# Displaying Data

Once you've gathered your relevant data you are ready to add it to a QGIS project. This group of pages documents how to load and display different kinds of data, examine the attribute of data layers, adjust the layers' symbology, and project/reproject as needed. Sometimes data that are not overtly geospatial data can be specialized by a GIS because they contain a locational component. For instance, a tabular dataset with street addresses can be geocoded, a historical map with streets and landform features can be georeferenced, and a spreadsheet of authors and their home cities can be joined to a vector layer of cities. The following pages will explain all these workflows further.
