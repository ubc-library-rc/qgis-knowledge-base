# QGIS Knowledge Base

This repository is a growing collection of short demos for common tools and workflows in QGIS. Tools and workflows are grouped together under parent pages 'Finding Data', 'Displaying Data', 'Modifying Vector Data'.... At the bottom of each page you will find a list of resources to learn more. This knowledge base is not a comprehensive course on QGIS but rather a starting place to come with questions. Each page group contains an exercise page that will guide you through some of the documented tools. Download the Knowledge Base Data and QGIS Project here to follow along.
